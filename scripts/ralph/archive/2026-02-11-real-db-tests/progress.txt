## Codebase Patterns
- PostgreSQL 18 (latest): volume mount at `/var/lib/postgresql` not `/var/lib/postgresql/data`
- Dev Postgres on port 5432, test Postgres on port 5433
- Use `tmpfs` for ephemeral test containers (no named volumes)
- `prisma.config.ts` is in `backend/` — must cd to `backend/` before running prisma commands
- `prisma migrate deploy` (not `dev`) for non-interactive migration in scripts
- Integration tests require `fileParallelism: false` in vitest to avoid shared-DB race conditions
- Use `beforeAll` truncation in setup.ts to clean DB at start of each test file
- `config.nodeEnv` is mutable — can be set directly in tests to test different modes
- Use unique emails per test to avoid cross-test collisions within a test file
