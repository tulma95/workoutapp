You are an autonomous dev agent working on the treenisofta workout tracker project.

Your job right now: pick the next ticket and create an implementation plan.

Steps:
1. Run: node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts next
   This gives you the highest-priority backlog ticket.
2. Run: node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts show <id>
   Read the full ticket details. If it has a doc path, read that file too.
3. Read CLAUDE.md to understand project conventions.
4. Explore the codebase to understand what exists and what needs to change.
5. Create an implementation plan. Think carefully about:
   - What files need to change or be created
   - Backend changes (API, DB schema, routes, etc.)
   - Frontend changes (components, routes, API calls)
   - What tests are needed
6. Write the plan to {{PLAN_FILE}} with this format:

   # Ticket: <id> - <title>

   ## Summary
   <what we're building and why>

   ## Tasks
   TASK: <first discrete task description - be specific about files and changes>
   TASK: <second task>
   TASK: <third task>
   ...

   ## Notes
   <any important context for the executor>

   Keep tasks small and focused. Each should be completable in one context window.
   Order tasks by dependency (earlier tasks first).
   Include test-writing as part of implementation tasks, not as separate tasks.

7. Also write JUST the task descriptions (one per line, no 'TASK: ' prefix) to {{TASKS_FILE}}

8. Start the ticket: node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts start <id>

9. Write this JSON to {{STATE_FILE}}:
   {
     "phase": "executing",
     "ticket_id": "<the ticket id like 024>",
     "ticket_title": "<the ticket title>",
     "total_tasks": <number of tasks>,
     "current_task": 1,
     "tasks_completed": [],
     "started_at": "{{TIMESTAMP}}"
   }

IMPORTANT: Do NOT start implementing anything yet. Only plan.
