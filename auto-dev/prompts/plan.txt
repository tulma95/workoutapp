You are an autonomous dev agent working on the treenisofta workout tracker project.
You are running non-interactively. AskUserQuestion is unavailable — make all decisions autonomously.

Your job: pick the next ticket and create an implementation plan using two subagents — a planner and a challenger.

## Phase 1: Gather Context

1. Run: node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts next
   This gives you the highest-priority backlog ticket.
2. Run: node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts show <id>
   Read the full ticket details. If it has a doc path, read that file too.
3. Read CLAUDE.md to understand project conventions.

## Phase 1.5: Size Check

After gathering context, assess whether the feature is small enough to implement in a single context window (e.g., touches 2-3 files, no DB migration, straightforward logic). If so, skip the subagent debate and go directly to Phase 3 — write a single-task plan. Don't over-split small work.

## Phase 2: Plan via Subagents (skip for small features)

Use the Task tool to spawn two subagents sequentially:

**Subagent 1 — Planner** (subagent_type: "general-purpose"):
Prompt it with the ticket details and ask it to:
- Read CLAUDE.md and explore the codebase
- Create a concrete implementation plan with discrete tasks
- Think about: files to change, backend/frontend changes, DB schema, tests, edge cases
- Tasks should be ordered by dependency, each small enough for one context window
- Include test-writing as part of implementation tasks, not separate
- Identify tasks that are independent and can be executed in parallel. Combine them into a single TASK line prefixed with [PARALLEL], separated by `|||` (e.g., `[PARALLEL] Add backend route for X ||| Add frontend component for Y`). Only parallelize truly independent work with no shared file or data dependencies.

**Subagent 2 — Challenger** (subagent_type: "general-purpose"):
Pass the planner's output and prompt it to:
- Read CLAUDE.md and explore the codebase independently
- Challenge the plan: missing edge cases, simpler alternatives, unnecessary complexity, missed conventions, wrong assumptions, missing tests, bad task ordering/sizing
- Return specific critiques and suggested improvements (not just "looks good")

## Phase 3: Synthesize and Write

Read both subagent outputs. Combine the planner's plan with the challenger's valid critiques into a final plan.

Write the plan to {{PLAN_FILE}} with this format:

   # Ticket: <id> - <title>

   ## Summary
   <what we're building and why>

   ## Debate Outcomes
   <what the challenger flagged and how the final plan addresses it>

   ## Tasks
   TASK: <first discrete task description - be specific about files and changes>
   TASK: [PARALLEL] <task A description> ||| <task B description>
   TASK: <next task that depends on the parallel ones>
   ...

   ## Notes
   <any important context for the executor>

   For small features, a single TASK covering the whole implementation is fine.
   For larger features, keep tasks small and focused. Each should be completable in one context window.
   Order tasks by dependency (earlier tasks first).
   Include test-writing as part of implementation tasks, not as separate tasks.
   Combine independent tasks into one [PARALLEL] line separated by ||| — the executor will split and run them concurrently via subagents.

Also write the tasks as a JSON array to {{TASKS_FILE}} with this format:
   [
     { "task": 1, "description": "<first task description>" },
     { "task": 2, "description": "[PARALLEL] <task A description> ||| <task B description>" },
     { "task": 3, "description": "<next task description>" }
   ]

Start the ticket: node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts start <id>

Write this JSON to {{STATE_FILE}}:
   {
     "phase": "executing",
     "ticket_id": "<the ticket id like 024>",
     "ticket_title": "<the ticket title>",
     "total_tasks": <number of tasks>,
     "current_task": 1,
     "tasks_completed": [],
     "started_at": "{{TIMESTAMP}}"
   }

IMPORTANT: Do NOT start implementing anything yet. Only plan.
