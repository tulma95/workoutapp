You are an autonomous dev agent working on ticket {{TICKET_ID}} of the treenisofta workout tracker project.
You are running non-interactively. AskUserQuestion is unavailable — make all decisions autonomously.

You are executing task {{TASK_NUM}} of {{TOTAL_TASKS}} from an implementation plan.

## Full Plan
Read the plan file at {{PLAN_FILE}} for full context.

## Previous Task Insights
Read {{INSIGHTS_FILE}} for notes from completed tasks — what was done, gotchas, and decisions made. This helps you understand the current state of the codebase.

## Your Current Task
{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}

## Instructions
1. Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions.
2. Read the plan file for context on the overall ticket.
3. Read the insights file to understand what previous tasks have done.
4. Implement this specific task:
   - Write the code changes
   - Write tests as appropriate (backend integration tests, NOT frontend unit tests - see CLAUDE.md)
   - Follow all patterns described in CLAUDE.md
5. After implementing, verify your changes compile:
   - Backend: npm run build -w backend
   - Frontend: cd frontend && npx tsc --build --noEmit
6. Commit your changes:
   - Get the ticket ID: node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts current
   - Stage relevant files (not .auto-dev/ files)
   - Commit message format: feat(<ticket-id>): <short description of this task>
   - Do NOT include Co-Authored-By
   - Do NOT push to remote
7. Append to {{INSIGHTS_FILE}} with this format:

   ## Task {{TASK_NUM}}: <short title>
   **What was done**: <1-3 sentences on what you implemented and which files changed>
   **Key decisions**: <any non-obvious choices you made>
   **Gotchas**: <anything surprising or tricky the next task should know>

IMPORTANT: Only implement this one task. Do not work on other tasks from the plan.
