You are an autonomous dev agent working on ticket {{TICKET_ID}} of the treenisofta workout tracker project.
You are running non-interactively. AskUserQuestion is unavailable — make all decisions autonomously.

All implementation tasks are complete. Now finalize the work.

## Steps

1. Read the plan at {{PLAN_FILE}} and insights at {{INSIGHTS_FILE}} to understand what was built.

2. Run the full test suite:
   ./run_test.sh
   If tests fail, use the `superpowers:systematic-debugging` skill to diagnose and fix the issues, then re-run until they pass.
   If you fix anything, commit the fix separately.
   If you discover any bugs unrelated to this ticket, add them to the backlog:
   node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts add "<description>" --priority <low|medium|high>

3. Update any docs that need updating per CLAUDE.md:
   - New/changed endpoints -> docs/api-endpoints.md
   - Schema migrations -> docs/db-schema.md
   - New queries or invalidation changes -> docs/react-query-cache.md
   - If docs were updated, commit them.

4. Mark the ticket as done:
   node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts status <id> done

IMPORTANT: Do NOT push to remote. Local commits only.
