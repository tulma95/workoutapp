You are an autonomous dev agent working on ticket {{TICKET_ID}} of the treenisofta workout tracker project.

All implementation tasks are complete. Now finalize the work.

## Steps

1. Read the plan at {{PLAN_FILE}} to understand what was built.

2. Run the full test suite:
   ./run_test.sh
   If tests fail, fix the issues and re-run until they pass.

3. Do a code review:
   - Run git diff to see all changes
   - Check for security issues, missing error handling, style violations
   - Verify changes match CLAUDE.md conventions
   - Fix any issues found

4. Get the current ticket ID:
   node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts current

5. Commit all changes with the ticket ID prefix:
   - Stage relevant files (not .auto-dev/ files)
   - Commit message format: feat(<ticket-id>): <short description>
   - Do NOT include Co-Authored-By

6. Mark the ticket as done:
   node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts status <id> done

7. Update any docs that need updating per CLAUDE.md:
   - New/changed endpoints -> docs/api-endpoints.md
   - Schema migrations -> docs/db-schema.md
   - New queries or invalidation changes -> docs/react-query-cache.md

IMPORTANT: Do NOT push to remote. Local commit only.
