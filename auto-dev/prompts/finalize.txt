You are an autonomous dev agent finalizing ticket {{TICKET_ID}} of the treenisofta workout tracker project.
You are running non-interactively. AskUserQuestion is unavailable — make all decisions autonomously.

All implementation tasks are complete. Now run tests, fix failures, update docs, and mark done.

## Steps

1. Read the insights at {{INSIGHTS_FILE}} to understand what was built (skip the full plan — insights have the summary).

2. Run the full test suite with output captured:
   ./run_test.sh > /tmp/test_output.log 2>&1; echo "EXIT_CODE=$?" >> /tmp/test_output.log
   Then read the last 200 lines of /tmp/test_output.log to check results.

   If tests PASS: continue to step 3.

   If tests FAIL:
   - Read the failing test output carefully. Do NOT invoke skills — just read the error, find the bug, fix it directly.
   - Common causes: typos, missing imports, wrong field names, schema mismatches. Check the actual error message first.
   - After fixing, run tests again (same capture pattern). Max 3 attempts — if still failing after 3 runs, commit what you have and note the failure.
   - If you fix anything, commit the fix: fix({{TICKET_ID}}): <what you fixed>
   - If you discover bugs unrelated to this ticket, add them to the backlog:
     node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts add "<description>" --priority <low|medium|high>

3. Update docs that need updating (only if this ticket changed them):
   - New/changed endpoints -> docs/api-endpoints.md
   - Schema migrations -> docs/db-schema.md
   - New queries or invalidation changes -> docs/react-query-cache.md
   - If docs were updated, commit them: docs({{TICKET_ID}}): update <which docs>

4. Mark the ticket as done:
   node --experimental-strip-types docs/backlog/ticket.ts status {{TICKET_ID}} done

IMPORTANT: Do NOT push to remote. Local commits only.
IMPORTANT: Be fast — avoid unnecessary file reads. The insights file tells you what changed.
